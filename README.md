# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

This is my capstone project for the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**, where I analyzed Cyclistic’s 2019 bike-share trip data to uncover behavioral trends and help guide the company’s marketing strategy. The goal: understand how **casual riders** differ from **annual members**, and identify ways to convert more casual users into paying members.

##  Business Objective

Cyclistic’s marketing team wants to increase the number of annual memberships. To support this effort, I conducted a detailed analysis to answer:

> "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"

##  Key Insights

| Insight | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ride Length** | Casual riders take significantly longer trips than members |
| **Day of Week** | Casual rides peak on weekends; members ride steadily throughout the week |
| **Time of Day** | Casual users ride more in the afternoon and evening; members peak around morning/evening commutes |
| **Stations** | Casual riders start trips most often at tourist-heavy downtown locations |
| **Age Patterns** | Most riders were born between 1980 and 2000; older outliers were removed for accuracy |

- Created new features like `ride_length`, `hour`, and `day_of_week`

### ANALYZE
- Compared usage patterns between user types across time, age, and location

### SHARE
- Built a clean, modular Python notebook with commentary and visualizations
- Published findings and charts to GitHub

### ACT
- Recommend targeting casual riders with:
